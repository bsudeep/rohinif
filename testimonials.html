								<p>Rohini has an uncanny ability to communicate with dogs. Over the past 1.5 years she has trained my nut case Lab with mind blowing success. After getting Joey, I was lucky enough to be guided quickly to Rohini’s expertise. In her typical gentle style she works her magic. Never once she has raised her voice even and trust me my lab can get quite a handful at times. We love Rohini for the tender, caring, amazing manner she has demonstrated with my fur baby.</p>

								<p>We visited Rohini once with our 4 year old German Shepherd, Kai. That was the only session we required. The issue was what was previously diagnosed as aggression. Rohini aptly corrected that prognosis and also provided us with a solution that worked Instantly! By instantly, I mean under 5 minutes. Impressed is an understatement in how Rohini was able to remove 3 years of a stressed trait and this has allowed us to really be able to enjoy our dog more. Blind faith in her skill and experience.</p>

						<h3>Himani Shetty<hr class="yellow-line"></h3>

						<p>We have 2 indie dogs, Sniffy (female) and Rowdy (male), they have been with us for the past couple of years. In the initial months post adoption, we faced a severe problem with the dogs howling every time we left them alone at home. Came to a point where I was either stranded at home or had to take them everywhere I went.</p>

						<img src="images/testimonials-himani-sniffy-rowdy.jpg" alt="HImani, Sniffy and Rowdy" class="img-responsive margin-bottom-30">

						<p>A friend suggested we visit Rohini to see if she could help us with this problem. With no exaggeration, it took one consultation with her to completely solve the problem. She explained to us what the issue is, and how we need to handle it. There hasn't been a problem since then, and we really appreciate her help to get us to better understand our dogs and have a great time with them.</p>

								<p>My son Bruno,aone year old male Labrador, is taking training sessions from Rohiniand it is a pleasure to say that it has been a wonderful experience for me as well as my boy. The training sessions are truly motivating for us, as she trains us to teach Bruno the commands. We then practice the commands in different situations and have now got a lot of control over him. Bruno is a well behaved boy in spite of his mischievous nature thanks to her.</p>

						<h3>Anu Vaish<hr class="yellow-line"></h3>

						<p>Our family moved from New York to Mumbai in 2007 and I would often read about Rohini in the newspapers and magazines - about all the wonderful work she was doing in bringing very special dogs to help adults and children, all with their own special needs. I read about the progress many of these individuals had made, some even miraculous. Then one day I had the pleasure of observing her team at a school, as they conducted pet therapy with the students.</p>

						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-md-4">
								<img src="images/testimonials-annu-ace-1.jpg" alt="Annu and Ace" class="img-responsive margin-bottom-30">
							</div>

							<div class="col-md-8">
								<p>I asked them for help to locate a pet appropriate for my son's needs. She kindly agreed, met with my son and understood his needs. In the summer of 2009, she found our amazing angel - Ace, a beautiful golden Labrador pup. I could not believe how perfect Ace was for our family. It was, as if she had customized the animal for us. Shetrained him and taught us how to take care of him as he was the first pet we had ever had. Most impressively, she trained Ace to be a Therapy Dog. He was trained in a very special manner to be a therapy pet.</p>
							</div>
						</div>

						<p>As a result of this special training, Ace is the most calm and composed dog I know. He is excited to give love. Ace never barks, never bites, senses who needs him most and will always be found next to that family member. Best of all Ace has a beautiful, silent sibling-like relationship with my son. They roll around and play rough, like friends would.</p>

						<p>My son sometimes pretends to ride him like a horse or may kick him by mistake. Ace does not seem to mind at all and knows exactly when to get out of the way so he is not trampled by him. Ace's therapeutic presence is not just helpful to my son. Amazingly I found my husband - a former 'animal hater' - to benefit from Ace as well. Each day as he returns from a grueling day of work, I find him kneeling at the door, quietly stroking the dog and enjoying every therapeutic moment of it. We love the fact that with help of Rohini we were able to bring home a companion for our special child.</p>

						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-md-4">
								<img src="images/testimonials-param-simba-1.jpg" alt="Param and Simba" class="img-responsive margin-bottom-30">
							</div>

							<div class="col-md-8">
								<p>Getting Simbaa has been one of the better decisions I have taken in life. Simbaa behaves as a perfect therapy dog should. Simbaa doesn't bark, is completely toilet trained, listens to commands of sitting, lying down, staying at a place, being within a particular periphery if asked and till the time he is released, and all the other basics. He is a thorough young, gentle, well behaved boy, shaping up I'm sure, to be a thorough gentleman.</p>
							</div>
						</div>

						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-md-8">
								<p>Simbaa has this uncanny understanding of sensing tension or stress in anyone at home even before it surfaces or becomes evident. The moment Jiyon starts to show unhappiness or aggression Simbaa is completely around Jiyon, either licking his hand or nudging him or jumping on him. It doesn't end there, Jiyon many times continues to be in anger, pulls Simbaa's tongue, ears. The strange part is Simbaa would not move away from Jiyon. He won't even like me holding Jiyon. He would continue to be with him, calming him down.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="col-md-4">
								<img src="images/testimonials-param-simba-2.jpg" alt="Param and Simba" class="img-responsive margin-bottom-30">
							</div>
						</div>						

						<p>Rohini, I can never thank you enough. Nothing of this would have been possible if you would not have trained Simbaa, the way you have - Reward vs reprimand in the form of firmness in behaviour, as against reward vs punishment. He listens to us because he loves to, knowing he will be rewarded. He never obeys due to fear. It makes such a huge difference. This was evident when Jet Airways allowed Simbaa to travel with Jiyon in the cabin as a therapy dog. With Simbaa around he was happy, calm and at times more composed than me when I am travelling :)... Jiyon kept patting Simbaa throughout the flight and Simbaa kept lying quietly down, sitting close to Jiyon's feet assuring him everything around is fine. We are blessed we have each other...</p>

								<p>Rohini has been amazing with training our dog Bobo. She helped us understand his behaviour when he was a puppy and would show us how to get him to respond to commands with love and patience. She has shaped him up to be a great therapy dog. Thanks to her training Bobo is bringing a lot of joy to so many people.</p>
